                <p>Over the past four months, I have had the distinct pleasure of preparing the <b><i>Christmas Oratorio</i></b>, <b>BWV 248</b>, by Johann Sebastian Bach, not only as a chorister but also as a soloist. This kind of opportunity to sing in such an independent capacity as part of an operation with substantial funding and high stakes is never to be scoffed at, but it is made even more remarkable by the fact that it is presented to college students. Something typically reserved for professional musicians, particularly when accompanied by a skilled (yet incredibly expensive) professional orchestra, I knew to snatch up this chance at any cost from the second I received a message from Andy Clark encouraging me to audition. From that day on, I worked tirelessly to perfect my aria of choice—<i>Frohe Hirten, eilt, ach eilet</i>—and this web application documents that winding journey. Please enjoy!</p>

                <h3>Why did I make this?</h3>
                <p>As the Harvard Choruses continue making a push to feature students as soloists more frequently, many more singers will go through this same process of learning and performing a piece in similar large-scale performances. My hope is for this web application to serve as an example of how one can successfully go about preparing an aria. For example, if a chorister is unsure about what a timeline for learning a piece could look like, they could use this as a starting point and adjust it to their needs for the specific piece. Moreover, if someone does not know how to be methodical in approaching learning a difficult piece to a very high level, this can serve as inspiration for different topics that make sense to isolate throughout the journey. As long as this helps even a singular person gain clarity in their process for preparing a piece at some point after I have graduated, my goal will have been accomplished.</p>

                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                <p>I am Xavier Evans, a senior at the college studying Computer Science and Linguistics. Originally from the small town of West Milford in North Central West Virginia, I have been singing for my entire life. I am a fourth-year member and former president of the Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum. In our 2021 performance of Handel’s <b><i>Messiah</i></b>, I was the soloist for <i>Comfort ye my people</i> and <i>Every valley shall be exalted</i>. Last year, I had the opportunity to sing the tenor aria <i>Was willst du dich, mein Geist, entsetzen</i> in Collegium’s performance of Bach’s <b><i>Liebster Gott, wenn werd ich sterben</i></b>, <b>BWV 8</b> and to sing alongside professional soloists for <i>Duo Seraphim</i> from Monteverdi's <b><i>Vespers (1610)</i></b>. The newest addition to my singing bio is precisely what I will be discussing here today: <i>Frohe Hirten, eilt, ach eilet</i> from Bach's <b><i>Christmas Oratorio</i></b>.</p>

                <h3>Who helped me?</h3>
                <p>Charley Blandy was the teacher with whom I worked the longest during my college career. He, unfortunately, had a change in career plans and is no longer working for the Holden Voice Program, so I stopped taking lessons with him in Spring 2022. I still credit him for most of the development I have seen in my voice up until this point since we worked together for six semesters. This year, I started working with the illustrious Christopher Sierra. They are an absolute ball of energy, and no one would be a better pick to fill Charley's enormous shoes. They gave me additional guidance as I learned this piece, even though we didn't have time for many lessons this semester. Additionally, I was privileged enough to have two coaching sessions with guest artists hired by the Holden Voice Program: Beth Marshall and Pam Dellal. It was vital to get fresh eyes on this piece since I had gotten so comfortable with it after two months of hard work, and their insights reinvigorated the aria and got me excited to make the final push to concert day. I am indebted to these four teachers for their invaluable guidance, and I could not have delivered as stellar a performance without them.</p>

                <p>Before we get into the details, take a listen to my performance! At the risk of biasing your listening experience, I must say that I am incredibly proud of the way this turned out! I was feeling incredibly unwell the entire day leading up to the concert due to receiving my COVID booster the night prior—so unwell that I decided to rest instead of going to the final rehearsal right before the concert. I rolled out of bed with just enough time to get dressed and walk onto the stage when I arrived at Sanders, and I am so glad that is what I did! I felt more rested than ever going into a concert, and my voice felt as fresh as a daisy and as light as a cool summer breeze. I knew the solo was going to go to plan from first notes the orchestra played and especially when I walked out to begin singing. This self-assurance in itself is not to be underestimated in its affect on the quality of the performance, and I attribute this to my through preparation. I hope this confidence and, because of it, the ability to focus on musicality and being present translates well through the recording.</p>

                <p>My key to success for learning this piece was having a solid plan before ever singing the first note. Although a bit excessive, perhaps, at the beginning of the semester, I created an excruciatingly detailed flow of how I would learn the piece over the coming months. I will start by presenting a rather general scaffold of the timeline and then elaborate on each of the phases.</p>
